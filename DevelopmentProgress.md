## Technical Deep Dives

### DAG Editor Implementation Details
The DAG Editor is a cornerstone of the PromptHub platform, enabling complex prompt workflows:

1. **Editor Architecture**
   - Canvas-based node editor using React Flow
   - Custom node types for different prompt components
   - Serializable graph state for storage and sharing
   - Real-time collaborative editing capabilities

2. **Node Types**
   - Prompt Nodes (text, chat, completion)
   - Transformation Nodes (extraction, filtering, formatting)
   - Conditional Nodes (branching, if-then-else)
   - Input/Output Nodes (variables, parameters)
   - Tool Nodes (API calls, data retrieval)

3. **Execution Engine**
   - Topological sorting for execution order
   - Caching system for intermediate results
   - Parallel execution where possible
   - Detailed execution logs and debugging tools

### PDL (Prompt Description Language) Specification
PDL provides a standardized way to define prompts:

1. **Schema Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "metadata": {
       "name": "Entity Extractor",
       "description": "Extracts named entities from text",
       "author": "PromptHub",
       "tags": ["extraction", "nlp"]
     },
     "inputs": {
       "text": {"type": "string", "required": true},
       "entities": {"type": "array", "required": false, "default": ["person", "org", "location"]}
     },
     "template": "Extract the following entities from the text:\n{{entities | join(\", \")}}\n\nText: {{text}}\n\nEntities:",
     "parameters": {
       "temperature": 0.2,
       "max_tokens": 500
     },
     "output_schema": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "entities": {
           "type": "array",
           "items": {
             "type": "object",
             "properties": {
               "type": {"type": "string"},
               "value": {"type": "string"},
               "position": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "number"}}
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Template Language**
   - Variable substitution: `{{variable_name}}`
   - Filters: `{{variable | filter(args)}}`
   - Conditionals: `{% if condition %}...{% endif %}`
   - Loops: `{% for item in items %}...{% endfor %}`

3. **Validation System**
   - Input validation against schema
   - Output validation for model responses
   - Error reporting and suggestion system

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation
MCP standardizes interactions with various AI models:

1. **Adapter Architecture**
   - Provider-specific adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Common interface for all model interactions
   - Request/response transformation layers
   - Authentication and API key management

2. **Context Optimization**
   - Window size tracking and enforcement
   - Content chunking strategies
   - Compression techniques for longer contexts
   - Token counting estimations

3. **Request Standardization**
   ```typescript
   interface MCPRequest {
     prompt: string | PromptMessage[];
     model: string;
     parameters: {
       temperature?: number;
       max_tokens?: number;
       top_p?: number;
       frequency_penalty?: number;
       presence_penalty?: number;
     };
     tools?: Tool[];
     metadata?: Record<string, any>;
   }
   ```

### Smart Contract Integration
The blockchain components enable decentralized ownership and monetization:

1. **Contract Architecture**
   - PromptRegistry: Core registry for prompt ownership
   - PromptMarketplace: Trading and licensing functionality
   - RoyaltyDistributor: Manages payment allocation
   - VersionControl: Tracks prompt versions and lineage

2. **On-Chain Verification**
   - Hash-based prompt verification
   - Execution proof submission
   - Challenge-response mechanism for disputes
   - Signature verification for authorized usage
