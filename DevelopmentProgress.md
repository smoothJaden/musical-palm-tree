# PromptHub Development Progress Tracker

**Document Status**: Active  
**Last Updated**: April 29, 2023  
**Maintainer**: Project Lead

This document tracks the development progress of the PromptHub platform across all components. It serves as the central reference for project status, upcoming milestones, and completed work.

## Project Overview

PromptHub is being developed as a decentralized platform for creating, sharing, and monetizing AI prompts. The project consists of several key components:

1. **prompthub-app**: Frontend application and user interface
2. **prompthub-protocol**: Core protocol implementation
3. **prompthub-sdk**: Developer toolkit and APIs
4. **prompthub-mcp**: Model Context Protocol implementation
5. **prompthub-docs**: Project documentation

## Current Development Phase

**Current Phase**: Initial Setup and Planning

The project is currently in the planning and initial setup phase. We have:
- Completed the product design documentation
- Established the documentation repository structure
- Defined the high-level architecture
- Planned the development sequence

## Development Sequence Plan

We've established the following development sequence:
